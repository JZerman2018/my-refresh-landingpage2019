## Overview

This was a starter project with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, along with the JavaScript file.

The page navigation was built dynamically using JavaScript. This project was required to remain a mentor and reviewer in the new Front-End program at Udacity.
